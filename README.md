# Diabetes Linear Regression

This is a Python program that demonstrates linear regression using the Diabetes dataset from scikit-learn. It also implements different methods for linear regression, including using the scikit-learn library, solving the normal equation, performing basic gradient descent, and stochastic gradient descent.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- scipy

You can install these libraries using the following command:
pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib scipy


## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Python script in your preferred development environment.

3. Run the script.

The script will load the Diabetes dataset, split it into training and testing data, and perform linear regression using different methods, showing intercepts, coefficients, and errors on both the training and testing datasets.

## Methods Demonstrated

1. **Scikit-learn Linear Regression**
   - Utilizes the scikit-learn library for linear regression.
   - Displays the intercept, coefficients, and training/testing errors.

2. **Normal Equation**
   - Implements linear regression using the normal equation.
   - Shows the intercept, coefficients, and training/testing errors.

3. **Basic Gradient Descent**
   - Performs linear regression using basic gradient descent.
   - Displays the intercept, coefficients, and training/testing errors.

4. **Stochastic Gradient Descent**
   - Demonstrates linear regression using stochastic gradient descent.
   - Shows the intercept, coefficients, and training/testing errors.

## Output

The program will provide information and visualization for the various linear regression methods, including intercepts, coefficients, and learning curves.
